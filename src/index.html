<h1>The Starter Kit!</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This has been created with my workflow in mind. It provides a responsive header and footer, working dark mode,
  eleventy configuration and the startings to make a lightning-fast, vanilla website.
</p>

<br />

<h2>File Structure</h2>
<p>
  The kit follows a very traditional project structure. All dev files are found in /src, and therefore all development
  should occur in there. On npm start/npm build, eleventy will build a project into /public. All SASS gets compiled,
  too. The root level only contains git and node files, alongside the eleventy config file. This shouldn't require too
  much modification, outside of setting up the image plugin.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>_data</h4>
    <p>
      All site-wide data is kept in here. Comes with client.json for all client-related data. If there's a group of
      related data, create a file and store it in here. A good example would be a restaurant menu list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>_includes</h4>
    <p>
      For 11ty templates and files. Feel free to organise into folders as the project grows. If there is a particular
      component that will be reused a lot, create a template for it (+ a mixin too?)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>assets</h4>
    <p>For all non-code related assets, except images</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>images</h4>
    <p>
      Unmodified images get stored in here. This is because eleventy will convert images in this folder to responsive,
      optimised webp images, and will not pass through the starting images.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>pages</h4>
    <p>One html file for each page. Use the same frontmatter for each page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>sass</h4>
    <p>
      All SASS styles in here. Follows a similar structure to the 7-1 architecture, but uses components and critical, as
      opposed to layout and components. Partials in critical will be loaded first, so put all components above the fold
      in here. Other reusable styles belong in components. Page-specific, non-reusable styles go in the corrosponding
      page partial
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<br />

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Follow the steps below to use the kit</p>
<br />
<ol>
  <li>Update the _data/client.json to represent accurate client data.</li>
  <li>Create a html file in pages/ for each page desired. Use the same frontmatter template for each page.</li>
  <li>
    Use <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">https://realfavicongenerator.net/</a> to create favicons. Place
    result into _includes/base.html.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <a href="https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts">https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts</a> to self host Google Fonts. Place
    into /assets/fonts, and create necessary variables and text components.
  </li>
  <li>Update colour variables in sass/utilities/_variables.scss.</li>
  <li>
    Tweak header styles. Delete changeNavBackground and its corrosponding listener from /assets/js/nav.js if needed,
    along with the scrolled class in sass/critical/_header.scss too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the desired widths of images in .eleventy.js, line 15. Pick the largest width for mobile, tablet and pc. Set the
    breakpoints accordinly in line 7 too. When an image needs to be used, use the generated shortcode to save time on
    asset optimisation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Search the design throughly, and find anything that could be reused. Spacings can be turned into variables. Groups
    of elements can be turned into macros, with mixins for differing styles between a macro.
  </li>
  <li>Clear index.html and sass/pages/_home.scss of any markup and styles. Begin!</li>
</ol>
